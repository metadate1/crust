# Verification record

This file records observed checks for the initial private rewrite delivery on 2026-07-12 and the
stream, title, GOOL, entity, SLST, camera, cached-scene and hosted-runtime slices on 2026-07-13. It
does not turn subsystem tests into a claim of retail gameplay parity.

## Reference characterization

The Bandicoot source tree was treated as read-only at
`7f05e5febd63e603f243c089c8b9918211c7b991`. An external archive build passed 17 native C and two
JavaScript tests plus its Emscripten build. Its Chrome title sequence reached numeric states
`10 → 7 → 8 → 5` and then Intro `0x38`. The source working tree, including pre-existing untracked
forensics files, was unchanged after characterization.

## Legally local data

The opt-in local-data test and browser pass used the user's own NTSC-U image without copying it into
this repository. Detection reported Mode 2/2352, 88 streams, 44 exact pairs, and 229,312,048 logical
stream bytes. Every filename and declared extent was matched against the extracted S0–S3 set.

Read-only scene characterization covered 1,223 ZDAT entries, 1,735 paths, 520 WGEO entries and
1,726 SLST entries containing 138,038 items. All 43 playable LDAT spawn zones/paths resolved. The
static scene builder produced world commands for 40 starts; Title, Hog Wild and Whole Hog use
zero-world dummy starts with external SLST placeholders. Exhaustive mutable-SLST characterization
covered 1,726 resolved paths, 136,312 visibility states, 134,586 adjacent transitions, 269,172
forward/backward inverse round trips and 89,666,970 validated polygon references, with fingerprint
`0x1400935c08cfe148`.

All 4,292 retail ZDAT entities and 16,363 signed entity path points parsed; every entity was in
group three. The data contained 52 main-object candidates, 624 valid executable/subtype bindings
and seven bindings that the retail program loader also rejects, with fingerprint
`0x71524c62fcbf6ddb`. N. Sanity Beach's progress-zero baseline remained 4 worlds and 681 visible
polygons. The observed first-presented state at path point two/draw count one produced 679 visible
polygons from both the extracted pair and directly from the raw BIN.

The real N. Sanity Crash program was then executed through its first retail host boundaries. Tests
verified absolute global call word `0x8609806e` to global PC 110, return at global PC 131, the exact
optional-pointer word `0x16be0e1f`, and both initial child-spawn requests with synchronous callbacks
and argument cleanup in one 67-instruction invocation, without treating any serialized word as a
native pointer. A negative dynamic child count was also verified as a non-spawning argument-pop
rather than an overflow error.

## Hosted retail-runtime slice

The 2026-07-13 opt-in tests used the same legally owned raw BIN in place and did not copy any disc
or stream bytes into the repository:

- The fractional camera/scene test discovered the complete retail catalog and successfully built a
  signed-8.8 progress snapshot for all 43 bootable pairs directly from the raw image. The three
  external-transition/dummy starts remained valid zero-world scenes rather than synthetic geometry.
- The N. Sanity runtime bridge scanned the displayed current-zone neighbors, attempted seven
  group-three entity spawns, bound all seven, and executed them through the shared typed arena/VM
  runtime. Crash synchronously hosted the characterized executable `5` and ShadC executable `29`
  children with their retail argument lists. Deterministic integration tests also verify
  zone-relative entity path position, rotation/mode flags, `0x1000` scale, subtype/PID/path/process
  defaults, player-vs-object color matrices and child transform inheritance.
- Parsed programs retain the complete checked item-four state table. State links apply the retail
  `status_c`/target-flags guard (including the `0x1002` invincibility augmentation), while initial
  and global-call frames share the process/register word array at `init_sp`. Code PCs, storage
  indices and entry slots use aligned checked tags; animation references intentionally remain byte
  offsets. Focused tests cover argument addressing, packed frames, frame-relative access and links.
- State rebind captures and clears the once pointer, runs its nested code synchronously before the
  state stamp, then runs the target external transition block after the stamp. Nested calls/returns,
  animation selection and hosted child spawns preserve this order; target state code resumes on a
  later object execution.
- Paging opcode `0x8b` cases one through six reproduce the checked reference-count/query behavior
  with explicit page/entry metadata. Opcode `0x1a` reads the same five-word pad history installed by
  the browser. The legal trace also crossed `0x85` suboperation zero path orientation, `0x8e`
  suboperation six entity colors, and the source-defined suboperation-three and suboperation-one
  solid query branches using validated ZDAT octrees and colors.
- The 300-frame N. Sanity run is intentionally not error-free. Its first source-derived fault is
  frame one: ShadC executable 29/state one, external word 40 `0x8e06de26` (post-fetch PC 41), where
  an active executable-31 object needs animation-derived bounds. The equivalent C branch reads
  uninitialized local vectors, so Rust returns `UnsupportedSolidObjectBounds(ObjectHandle(6))` and
  quarantines that exact object instead of reproducing undefined behavior or skipping the opcode.
- All 43 playable pairs built owned pointer-free camera graphs. Every non-title boot pair then ran
  300 automatic-camera ticks through one pair-scoped scene builder: 42 pairs and 12,600 exact
  camera-to-scene zone/path/point/draw identities passed with zero failures. N. Sanity's opening
  automatic chain crossed four paths in 192 ticks; a separate legal `CamFollow` golden projected
  its 43-point mode-five path and crossed to path five from a supplied retail player transform.

These are native, ignored-by-default local-data tests. They characterize the mounted retail data
and runtime boundary; they are not evidence of a browser playthrough or full GOOL parity.

## Browser checks actually performed

A generated release Wasm build was served on `127.0.0.1` and exercised with agent-browser 0.27.0
using its Chrome engine:

- Wasm bootstrap reached `running`; `__consoleErrors` stayed empty and WebGL reported error zero.
- Raw 632,083,536-byte BIN discovery mounted all 88 streams and exposed all 43 bootable pairs.
- The 88 extracted NSD/NSF files independently mounted all 44 pairs; direct boot of level `0x09`
  parsed 80 pages and 231 entries.
- Title/publisher progression reached main menu; Intro `0x38` and return were observed.
- Options changed SFX volume, and password and empty-card load screens were entered.
- Direct gameplay boot, keyboard movement/jump input, pause, mute, fullscreen, and WebAudio resume
  activity were exercised. Automatic resume restoration was observed after reload.
- A 393×852 responsive viewport rendered the complete touch pad, including shoulders, L3/R3,
  Start and Select. Touch mapping itself is covered by native tests; multitouch on physical mobile
  hardware was not performed.
- Unsupported input was rejected with an actionable error after a browser-discovered fix.
- The final network trace contained only same-origin HTML, CSS, bootstrap JavaScript, generated
  wasm-bindgen JavaScript and Wasm. No asset upload/request occurred, and there were no console or
  page errors.

The 2026-07-13 release build was then exercised in a fresh agent-browser 0.27.0 Chrome session:

- A 632,083,536-byte raw BIN was selected through the real file input. Client-side discovery
  produced 88 files, all 44 pairs, 43 boot targets, and 229,312,048 logical bytes.
- The data-backed flow mounted `0x19 → 0x38 → 0x19 → 0x03 → 0x2D → 0x19 → 0x03`. The debug surface
  confirmed that current and retained stream IDs converged after every asynchronous swap. Observed
  destination counts included 113/558 pages/entries for `0x19`, 41/149 for `0x38`, 77/304 for
  `0x03`, and 15/57 for `0x2D`.
- The host decoded and uploaded 432×144 retail loading images for `0x19` and `0x03`. The opt-in
  local renderer characterization decoded all 39 loading images present among bootable streams.
- Title cards, main menu, Options and Map were navigated with keyboard input. Live options changed
  SFX and music from 255 to 239 and toggled mono; a triggered SFX produced measured mixer peak 767.
- Keyboard completed the diagnostic movement goal once. A second run held the on-screen touch Up
  control, reached completion in 2.24 seconds, cleared its held visual state, and mounted `0x2D`.
  Pause/resume and mute/unmute changed live runtime state and were restored before continuing.
- A 390×844 viewport had zero horizontal overflow and displayed the complete touch controller. In
  that historical diagnostic build, completion created card slot zero. After reload, both
  versioned storage records remained, while the file input was empty and mounted-pair count returned
  to zero.
- WebGL reported error zero throughout. Console and page-error logs were empty. The network record
  contained only same-origin HTML, CSS, bootstrap JavaScript, generated wasm-bindgen JavaScript and
  Wasm; no game-data request or upload occurred.
- The exact final Wasm artifact was re-smoked with only the extracted `0x19` pair. It mounted
  113 pages/558 entries with WebGL error zero; when the title flow requested absent `0x38`, the
  simulation stopped as `BLOCKED`, retained `0x19`, and displayed the missing local filename rather
  than advancing or presenting the destination against stale assets.

The final camera/GOOL/cache artifact was rebuilt and reloaded at `http://127.0.0.1:4174/` in the
visible Codex in-app browser. Its DOM contained the complete local loader, disabled pre-mount runtime
controls and canvas; there was no framework error overlay and the captured console log was empty.
The response used `Cache-Control: no-store`, and the served Wasm hash matched the generated file.
Browser automation in this environment could not populate the operating-system file chooser, so
this exact artifact's raw-BIN import, hosted CamFollow and WebGL game scene are not claimed as
browser-exercised. The same BIN was exercised in place by all opt-in Rust tests described above. A
user can select it through the visible local-file control without changing the no-upload model.
The object/camera/scene path is connected in code and compiled to Wasm, but no completed retail
gameplay flow is claimed.

Screenshots and game data remained outside Git. See `COMPATIBILITY.md` for features that were not
exercised or are not yet connected to the live browser runtime.

## Final automated results

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`: passed.
- workspace Clippy with `-D warnings`: passed.
