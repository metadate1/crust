# Verification record

This file records observed checks for the initial private rewrite delivery on 2026-07-12 and the
stream-transition/loading-image vertical slice on 2026-07-13. It does not turn subsystem tests into
a claim of retail gameplay parity.

## Reference characterization

The Bandicoot source tree was treated as read-only at
`7f05e5febd63e603f243c089c8b9918211c7b991`. An external archive build passed 17 native C and two
JavaScript tests plus its Emscripten build. Its Chrome title sequence reached numeric states
`10 → 7 → 8 → 5` and then Intro `0x38`. The source working tree, including pre-existing untracked
forensics files, was unchanged after characterization.

## Legally local data

The opt-in local-data test and browser pass used the user's own NTSC-U image without copying it into
this repository. Detection reported Mode 2/2352, 88 streams, 44 exact pairs, and 229,312,048 logical
stream bytes. Every filename and declared extent was matched against the extracted S0–S3 set.

## Browser checks actually performed

A generated release Wasm build was served on `127.0.0.1` and exercised with agent-browser 0.27.0
using its Chrome engine:

- Wasm bootstrap reached `running`; `__consoleErrors` stayed empty and WebGL reported error zero.
- Raw 632,083,536-byte BIN discovery mounted all 88 streams and exposed all 43 bootable pairs.
- The 88 extracted NSD/NSF files independently mounted all 44 pairs; direct boot of level `0x09`
  parsed 80 pages and 231 entries.
- Title/publisher progression reached main menu; Intro `0x38` and return were observed.
- Options changed SFX volume, and password and empty-card load screens were entered.
- Direct gameplay boot, keyboard movement/jump input, pause, mute, fullscreen, and WebAudio resume
  activity were exercised. Automatic resume restoration was observed after reload.
- A 393×852 responsive viewport rendered the complete touch pad, including shoulders, L3/R3,
  Start and Select. Touch mapping itself is covered by native tests; multitouch on physical mobile
  hardware was not performed.
- Unsupported input was rejected with an actionable error after a browser-discovered fix.
- The final network trace contained only same-origin HTML, CSS, bootstrap JavaScript, generated
  wasm-bindgen JavaScript and Wasm. No asset upload/request occurred, and there were no console or
  page errors.

The 2026-07-13 release build was then exercised in a fresh agent-browser 0.27.0 Chrome session:

- A 632,083,536-byte raw BIN was selected through the real file input. Client-side discovery
  produced 88 files, all 44 pairs, 43 boot targets, and 229,312,048 logical bytes.
- The data-backed flow mounted `0x19 → 0x38 → 0x19 → 0x03 → 0x2D → 0x19 → 0x03`. The debug surface
  confirmed that current and retained stream IDs converged after every asynchronous swap. Observed
  destination counts included 113/558 pages/entries for `0x19`, 41/149 for `0x38`, 77/304 for
  `0x03`, and 15/57 for `0x2D`.
- The host decoded and uploaded 432×144 retail loading images for `0x19` and `0x03`. The opt-in
  local renderer characterization decoded all 39 loading images present among bootable streams.
- Title cards, main menu, Options and Map were navigated with keyboard input. Live options changed
  SFX and music from 255 to 239 and toggled mono; a triggered SFX produced measured mixer peak 767.
- Keyboard completed the diagnostic movement goal once. A second run held the on-screen touch Up
  control, reached completion in 2.24 seconds, cleared its held visual state, and mounted `0x2D`.
  Pause/resume and mute/unmute changed live runtime state and were restored before continuing.
- A 390×844 viewport had zero horizontal overflow and displayed the complete touch controller. A
  diagnostic completion created card slot zero. After reload, both versioned storage records
  remained, while the file input was empty and mounted-pair count returned to zero.
- WebGL reported error zero throughout. Console and page-error logs were empty. The network record
  contained only same-origin HTML, CSS, bootstrap JavaScript, generated wasm-bindgen JavaScript and
  Wasm; no game-data request or upload occurred.
- The exact final Wasm artifact was re-smoked with only the extracted `0x19` pair. It mounted
  113 pages/558 entries with WebGL error zero; when the title flow requested absent `0x38`, the
  simulation stopped as `BLOCKED`, retained `0x19`, and displayed the missing local filename rather
  than advancing or presenting the destination against stale assets.

Screenshots and game data remained outside Git. See `COMPATIBILITY.md` for features that were not
exercised or are not yet connected to the live browser runtime.

## Final automated results

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`: passed.
- workspace Clippy with `-D warnings`: passed.
- locked native workspace suite: 159 passed, zero failed, three legally local tests ignored by
  default.
- opt-in raw-disc, all-local-pairs and loading-image tests: three passed, zero failed; 39 retail
  loading images decoded without copying them into the repository.
- locked optimized native workspace build: passed.
- locked optimized `wasm32-unknown-unknown` web build: passed.
- generated web release: passed; Wasm payload was 380,886 bytes (SHA-256
  `0f77a1ec426e56d9912a8042f6b563967930d13b5b8ff755ee2a97b04f07f6cf`).
